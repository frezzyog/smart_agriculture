## 🟢 Project Context (Copy this part)

**Project Name**: Smart Agriculture 4.0 Ecosystem
**Project Goal**: To empower farmers with real-time AI-driven insights and automated control systems using IoT technology.

**Core Components**:
1.  **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller, 7-in-1 Soil Sensor (NPK, pH, Moisture, Temp, EC), Rain & Light sensors, and a Solar Power system.
2.  **Software Ecosystem**: 
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ with Tailwind CSS 4 for a premium real-time dashboard.
    *   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and FastAPI for AI services.
    *   **Connectivity**: MQTT (Aedes Broker) for sub-second data streaming and Socket.io for live UI updates.
    *   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for time-series data and secure authentication.
3.  **AI Implementation**: 
    *   **Model**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.
    *   **Features**: "AI Agronomist" Chatbot, In-Context Learning using JSON telemetry, and Hybrid Intelligence (combining AI reasoning with MAFF/CARDI agricultural standards).
    *   **Function**: Real-time stress detection, automated irrigation commands, and Khmer-language advisory.

**Target Audience**: Year 3 Project Judges and Agricultural Stakeholders.
**Design Aesthetic**: High-tech, premium, clean "Glassmorphism" UI, and professional agricultural visuals.

## 🔵 Example AI Prompts you can use:

### To generate slide designs (for ChatGPT/Claude):
> "Based on the project overview provided, help me design a 10-slide presentation. The tone should be professional and technical. Focus specifically on how the Software Ecosystem (Next.js/MQTT) and the AI Agronomist (Gemini) work together to automate farming. For each slide, provide a title, bullet points, and a recommendation for a visual/graphic."

### To generate realistic hardware visuals (for Flux/Midjourney):
> "A cinematic, high-tech shot of a 7-in-1 soil sensor placed in a lush green vegetable farm in Cambodia. The sensor is connected to a professional IP65 waterproof box containing an ESP32 microcontroller. A small solar panel is visible in the background. Soft morning sunlight, 8k resolution, photorealistic, agricultural technology style."

### To refine the Khmer text (for ChatGPT/Claude):
> "I have a presentation draft in Khmer for my Smart Ag 4.0 project. Based on the technical overview, can you check if the Khmer terminology used for 'In-Context Learning', 'Telemetry', and 'Sub-second latency' is professional and easy for judges to understand? [Paste your draft here]"
